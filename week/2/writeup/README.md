CMSC389R -{c0rn3erstone-air-27670}.
I read the python file given and followed the instructions. I connected to the socket and I guessed a username from what I researched on the internet. Then I iterated through the file rockyou.txt until the prog\
ram printed out that a password had worked with the username inputted. The result was being able to go into the server and into the flight
 records
