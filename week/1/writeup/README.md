As a developer hired by a company, it is my job to inform the company of any faults in their system. I would first tell my boss about the issue. From there, I will tell the public. From there the public would know that the company knows of the issue and that the company may fix the issue. If i found out and never told the company of the issue then it is my fault for the harm of the consumers. This is because since I am the only person who knew the issue and did not tell anyone of a higher position than I have failed as a developer. If a surgeon knew he could save someone and did not save that person then that surgeon is fully responsible for the death of that person. The same can be applied to a developer. You would want something fixed if you knew it put your life at risk.

I would constantly pester my company to give their full attention to this issue. This is because people lives are at stake. If my 
company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release, I will leave the company. I know that I put effort into stopping the release. I
If the company does not postpone then I can see that the company does not care about the safety of society and only care about money. If a company was made to make products for society then it is their duty to make sure that their product does not put lives at risk. People could argue that if the company does tell the public about the issue and consumers should use that product at their own risk then that absolves the company of any harm done. However, if the company was put into the shoes of the consumer, then they would not want a product that puts their life at risk. Others can argue that if the company postpones the release then the company can lose lots of money because of how much money was invested into making the product. This is true however, if someone where to be killed or harmed from the faultiness in the product then not only would they lose from the loss of sales but they can get hit with lawsuits, thus losing even more money because of things such as legal fees. There is no argument that can convince society that the company should release a product that is not finished. Wheather it is money or time, consumers value their life more than anything.
